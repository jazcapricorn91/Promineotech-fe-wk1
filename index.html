      <h2 >The Joseph kitties</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There are six cats in the Joseph household. Poly, Odyssey, Lil Miss, Osiris, Araidia, and Stella. Sometimes they fight, sometimes they 
        play, but usually they are just looking for a little love. Most are cats that adopted me and Osiris and Araidia are siblings from the same 
        litter that i started by fostering. It takes time to care for all of them, but it is worth it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <div>
      <h3>Lil Miss</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I raised Little Miss since she was three weeks old. In 2013 I lived with a family that just had a litter of kittens (3 white and one tabby), 
        and I helped ween her entire litter. They would stay in my room and I would take care of them. When they were old enough to adopt out, I was 
        gifted my choice of kitten and she was the lucky one. She has since to grown into a very silly kitty. She will get so happy, that she has been 
        known to roll off the edge of chairs and couches. Lil Miss can often be found sleeping in a bucket or a box if not the softest pile of blankets.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3>Poly</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Poly was brought home to me by my now ex-fiance. I was taking care of the liter of kitten and he came in with his coat wrapped up. "Shh, 
        I brought you something." She was a tough little gray tabby, and didn't take to the litter well, but she mellowed out as time went on. We noticed 
        she had quiet large paws and decided to count her toe beans. Turns out she was a polydactyl cat. These are also known as Hemingway cats. They are 
        known for their extra toes and are said to be good luck.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div>
      <h3 >Odyssey</h3>
        <p >Odyssey was found under my porch in the fall of 2013. She looked like she was the runt of her litter. Just a tiny baby and her eyes were glued shut 
          due to conjunctivitus. I took her in and nursed her back to health. She is a very sweet cat, but she is also very shy. She is still a tiny torti and 
          we love her. She is one of the few cats the other people are unable to find. But leave me alone in the house and she will come find me. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <br> 
   
    <div>
      <h3>Osiris</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Osiris is A big boy. He was part of a litter of three that I fostered back in 2016. At first we though he was a girl and named him Diana after the 
        moon goddess, but later on found out we had been mistaken. We settled on Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife. He is the protector of his 
        sister and keeps the peace in the household. When he is not around the cats are more likely to have disagreements,but no one messes with big boy.
      </p>

    <br>  

    <div>
      <h3>Aradia</h3>
      <br>
      <p> Araidia is Osiris's sister, She is the skiddish one. A is a small black cat with wide eyes. She is very sweet, but she is also very shy. 
        She is the only cat that will not come out to greet people when they come over.Often times she is the one that will hide under the bed or 
        in the cupboard above the fridge. She is also the one that will come out and sit on your lap when you are sad.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br>
    
    <div>
      <h3>Stella</h3>
      <p>Stella is the friendliest cat you have ever met. One day I opened my door and she ran right in. A black smooth kitty indeed, looking for 
        love and cuddles. Stella is always running around looking for someone to love, and she is always the first to greet you when you come in 
        the door. She is my youngest cat, i got her in 2018.
